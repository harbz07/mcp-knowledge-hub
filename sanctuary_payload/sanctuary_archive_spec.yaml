# Sanctuary Archive Synchronization Specification
# This YAML file serves as a declarative spec for synchronizing
# the contents of the local sanctuary archive with an external
# knowledge base (such as Operator or Notion). It outlines the
# critical paths, default behaviors, and metadata required to
# perform either a manual upload or an automated sync via an
# integration pipeline.

archive:
  # Absolute path to the local archive folder. Adjust this if
  # your environment mounts data elsewhere.
  path: "/mnt/data/archive"
  description: |
    A repository of rites, digital ephemera and miscellaneous
    artifacts that make up the sanctuary’s living memory. The
    folder structure and file names are preserved during sync to
    avoid any unholy side‑effects.
  # Target location for synchronization. Replace `your_notion_page_id`
  # with the actual page, database, or workspace identifier once you
  # have authenticated with Notion or Operator.
  destination:
    provider: "notion"  # or "operator" if using an internal system
    id: "your_notion_page_id"
  # Choose between manual upload or automated sync. When set to
  # `manual`, you are responsible for uploading the contents via
  # drag and drop or via the Notion UI. When set to `auto`, a
  # scheduled integration job (not included here) should watch for
  # changes and push updates accordingly.
  sync_mode: manual
  # ISO‑8601 timestamp of the last successful sync. Update this
  # whenever you complete a manual upload or run the automated job.
  last_synced: null

rituals:
  path: "/mnt/data/rituals"
  description: |
    Collection of ritual definitions, liturgies, and magical texts.
    These are seeded into the knowledge base as separate pages or
    database entries. The structure within this folder should remain
    flat, with one markdown or text file per ritual.

ledgers:
  path: "/mnt/data/ledgers"
  description: |
    Numerical and transactional records associated with the
    sanctuary’s operations. Ledger files are typically CSVs and
    should map cleanly to database tables within the external
    system.

notes:
  - Populate the `destination.id` field with your actual Notion page
    or database identifier once you have the credentials.
  - If you choose `sync_mode: auto`, ensure you have a separate
    automation script or integration service configured to read
    from these paths and push updates to the external provider.
  - Use consistent naming conventions; spaces and special glyphs
    within file names can cause unpredictable results with some APIs.
